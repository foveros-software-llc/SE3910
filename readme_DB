filters:
branch
date
time (start time)

will display:
branch   date   time   customer 

IF making all fields required before filtering then use the query below:
//all filters selected
select concat(bl.bankstreet,' ', bl.bankcity,' ', bl.bankstate,' ', bl.bankzipcode) as branch, a.appointmentdate, 
a.appointmentStartTime, concat(c.customerFirstName,' ', c.customerLastName) as customer
from customerappointments ca
join appointments a on a.appointmentid = ca.appointmentid
join banklocations bl on bl.banklocationid = a.banklocationid
join customers c on c.customerid = a.customerid

Recommendation: branch filter is combobox populated with query:
		-select concat(bankstreet,' ', bankcity,' ', bankstate,' ', bankzipcode) as branch from banklocations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF NOT making all fields required before filtering then use these queries:
//only date selected
select concat(bl.bankstreet,' ', bl.bankcity,' ', bl.bankstate,' ', bl.bankzipcode) as branch, a.appointmentdate, 
a.appointmentStartTime, concat(c.customerFirstName,' ', c.customerLastName) as customer
from customerappointments ca
join appointments a on a.appointmentid = ca.appointmentid
join banklocations bl on bl.banklocationid = a.banklocationid
join customers c on c.customerid = a.customerid
where a.AppointmentDate >= 'date_goes_here'  //format 'yyyy-mm-dd'

//only branch selected
//using the whole address
select concat(bl.bankstreet,' ', bl.bankcity,' ', bl.bankstate,' ', bl.bankzipcode) as branch, a.appointmentdate, 
a.appointmentStartTime, concat(c.customerFirstName,' ', c.customerLastName) as customer
from customerappointments ca
join appointments a on a.appointmentid = ca.appointmentid
join banklocations bl on bl.banklocationid = a.banklocationid
join customers c on c.customerid = a.customerid
where bl.bankstreet = '123 street'
      and bl.bankcity = 'Kansas City'
      and bl.bankstate = 'Missouri' 
      and bl.bankzipcode = '64063'
     
OR

//only using BankLocationId
select concat(bl.bankstreet,' ', bl.bankcity,' ', bl.bankstate,' ', bl.bankzipcode) as branch, a.appointmentdate, 
a.appointmentStartTime, concat(c.customerFirstName,' ', c.customerLastName) as customer
from customerappointments ca
join appointments a on a.appointmentid = ca.appointmentid
join banklocations bl on bl.banklocationid = a.banklocationid
join customers c on c.customerid = a.customerid
where bl.BankLocationId = 1

//for populating the "Branch" combobox:
-branches filter should be populated with either bankLocationId OR the whole address of banklocations available
	-Query for whole address: select concat(bankstreet,' ', bankcity,' ', bankstate,' ', bankzipcode) as branch 
				  from banklocations
	-Query for bankLocationId: select banklocationid from banklocations

-"Time" label will be changed to "Start Time": displays appointments on or after the entered time
	-Query: 
	select concat(bl.bankstreet,' ', bl.bankcity,' ', bl.bankstate,' ', bl.bankzipcode) as branch, a.appointmentdate, 
		a.appointmentStartTime, concat(c.customerFirstName,' ', c.customerLastName) as customer
		from customerappointments ca
		join appointments a on a.appointmentid = ca.appointmentid
		join banklocations bl on bl.banklocationid = a.banklocationid
		join customers c on c.customerid = a.customerid
		where a.AppointmentStartTime >= '14:00:00' //same as 2pm
	
Note: if the selected filters result in no results, display a message to let the user know that
